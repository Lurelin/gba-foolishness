# gba-foolishness
Literally just me messing around with the GBA

ideas:
- turn-based, army based, endless, randomly generated, monster hunter like resource management & crafting
- exploding kittens
- civ port/demake
- metroidvania, 1 hp, medieval, 
- factory game, but pipes instead of belts

factory game button map:
- L + A = zoom in
- L + B = zoom out
- R = change selection
- Start = change menus(menus = production, tile stats, settings)
