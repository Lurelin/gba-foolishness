# gba-foolishness
Literally just me messing around with the GBA

ideas:
- turn-based, army based, endless, randomly generated, monster hunter like resource management & crafting
- exploding kittens
- civ port/demake
- metroidvania, 1 hp, medieval, 
- factory game, but pipes instead of belts
- mario maker style game
- roguelike, but with an army
- stack
